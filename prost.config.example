# Required: Specify the three letter abbreviation of the species your samples
# are taken from.  For example, mouse is 'mmu', zebrafish is 'dre'.
species: mmu

# The file containing the list of samples files.
# samples_filelist: samples_filelist

# The maximum number of threads (processors) to use for various operations.
# max_threads: 4

# The prefix to use for Prost! output filenames.
# output_file_prefix: prost_output

# The minimum number times a sequence must appear as a read in the samples
# datasets in order to be included.
# min_seq_count: 30

# A sequence must have at least min_seq_length basepairs in order to be
# included by Prost!
# min_seq_length: 14

# A sequence must have at most max_seq_length basepairs in order to be
# included by Prost!
# max_seq_length: 28

# The maximum genetic wiggle.
# wiggle: 5

# The maximum number of genetic locations to report per sequence (if exceeded,
# it is simply reported as TML (too many locations).
# max_locations_to_report: 20

# Skip all sequence alignments.
# skip_sequence_alignments: no

# Skip the genome sequence alignment.
# skip_genome_alignment: no

# Skip the annotation sequence alignments.

# Note: This alignment exists for documentation purposes only.  It describes
# how to configure the several [*Alignments] below.
# ---
# [GenericAlignment]
# name: A human readable name for this alignment.
# tool: (bbmap|bbmapskimmer)
# db: Path to the aligner's reference.
# max_3p_mismatches: Maximum number of mismatches on the 3p end.
# max_non_3p_mismatches: Maximum number of mismatches on the 5p end and the
#   core of the alignment.  Effectively, this determines the maximum
#   designation of any sequence/bin in all Prost! output.
# allow_indels: (yes|no)
# type: Applicable only for AnnotationAlignments.
#   (MirbaseMirAnnotation|MirbaseHairpinAnnotation|BiomartOtherRNAAnnotation)
# indelnt_penalty_multiplier: Inserted/deleted nucleotides penalty multiplier (X).
#       Multiply the number of inserted or deleted nucleotides by X and add to
#       the number of non-3-prime mismatches in the alignment (Y); if Y is
#       greater than max_non_3p_mismatches, the hit will be rejected. 


# For the genome alignment, we recommend keeping the number of non-3-prime
# mismatches to '2' (i.e. 5-prime mismatches and "core" mismatches).
